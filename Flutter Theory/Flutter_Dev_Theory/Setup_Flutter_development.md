Setting up Flutter development involves a few steps, primarily focused on configuring your environment and tools. Since you already have the software set up, I will provide an overview of the remaining steps:

1. **Install Flutter SDK:**

   - Download the Flutter SDK from the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
   - Extract the downloaded file to a desired location.
2. **Update Your Path:**

   - Add the Flutter bin directory to your system path.
     - **Windows:**
       - Open **Control Panel** > **System and Security** > **System** > **Advanced system settings**.
       - Click **Environment Variables**, then under **User variables**, find the **Path** variable and add the path to the `flutter/bin` directory.
     - **macOS/Linux:**
       - Open a terminal and run:
         ```bash
         export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
         ```
3. **Run `flutter doctor`:**

   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     flutter doctor
     ```
   - This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. It will also highlight any additional dependencies you need to install, such as the Android SDK.
4. **Configure the Android Emulator:**

   - In Android Studio, go to **AVD Manager** (found in the toolbar).
   - Create a new virtual device and choose a device definition and system image.
5. **Install Visual Studio Code (Optional):**

   - Download and install Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Install the Flutter and Dart plugins from the VS Code marketplace.
6. **Create a New Flutter Project:**

   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     flutter create my_app
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd my_app
     ```
   - Open the project in your preferred code editor.
7. **Run Your Application:**

   - Ensure you have a device connected or an emulator running.
   - In the terminal, run:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```
