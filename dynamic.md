In Dart, the `dynamic` type allows you to assign any type of value to a variable. It bypasses the static type system, which means you can reassign a `dynamic` variable to any type of value at runtime. This can be useful in situations where the type of a value isn't known until runtime or when working with APIs that return mixed types of data.

Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating the use of `dynamic`:

```dart
void main() {
  // Declare a dynamic variable
  dynamic variable;

  // Assign an integer value
  variable = 42;
  print("Integer value: $variable");

  // Assign a string value
  variable = "Hello, Dart!";
  print("String value: $variable");

  // Assign a double value
  variable = 3.14;
  print("Double value: $variable");

  // Assign a list
  variable = [1, 2, 3];
  print("List: $variable");

  // Assign a map
  variable = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30};
  print("Map: $variable");

  // Example of changing types dynamically
  print("Type of variable is: ${variable.runtimeType}");

  variable = true;
  print("Boolean value: $variable");

  // Changing types and accessing as specific types
  variable = "42";
  int parsedValue = int.parse(variable); // Treat as a string and parse to int
  print("Parsed integer value: $parsedValue");
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Dynamic Declaration**:

   - `dynamic variable;` declares a variable of type `dynamic`. Initially, it doesn't have a value.
2. **Changing Values**:

   - The `variable` is assigned different types of values: integer, string, double, list, and map. Each time, the type of `variable` changes to match the assigned value.
3. **Accessing Runtime Type**:

   - `variable.runtimeType` gives the type of the current value held by `variable`.
4. **Working with Dynamic Data**:

   - In the last part, `variable` is first assigned a string `"42"`. The `int.parse(variable)` function is used to convert this string to an integer.

**Important Note**: While `dynamic` provides flexibility, it should be used judiciously. Overuse of `dynamic` can lead to less safe code because it bypasses compile-time type checking, making it easier to introduce bugs that would otherwise be caught by the type system.
